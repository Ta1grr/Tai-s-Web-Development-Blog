This first week was definitely hectic, I get to meet my fellow team members: Jared, Fred, Chad and Richard. Day 1, we get to plan everything out, choosing our technology, how we design the frontend and discuss about the backend schema (user data model). I think the problematic portion was setting a position of leadership. I tried to nominate Jared because he's a lot more knowledgeable and able to help in both front or backend.
