###The work, challenges I've faced, the tools I used, and my accomplishment.

The work I've done this week was setting up a landing page component with bareminimum structure, created a billing subscription component (bare minimum as well), and implement a structured layout in the app component which indirectly created the app data flow between each components and finally wrote in the auth.js to associate a user from the database with a freshly authenticated user.

Part 2 - Milestone Reflections

This first week was definitely hectic, I get to meet my fellow team members: Jared, Fred, Chad and Richard. Day 1, we get to plan everything out, choosing our technology, how we design the frontend and discuss about the backend schema (user data model). I think the problematic portion was setting a position of leadership. I tried to nominate Jared because he's a lot more knowledgeable and able to help in both front or backend.
